# Ready, Set, Simulate!

In Simulation Studio, you can monitor the performance of your model during the inferencing process. This allows you to make any necessary adjustments to improve the model's accuracy. It's a critical step in the development and optimization of machine learning models.

The possibilities with Siml.ai are endless. You can effortlessly modify input values, switch between various view modes, and immediately see the results of your changes. This flexibility makes it an invaluable tool for refining and perfecting machine learning models. All you have to do is modify the values or select from the dropdown in the “View” section of the simulation (located on top left) and click on “Simulate” to see the modified simulation!

Simulation Studio allows you to dissect the simulation outputs in different ways. You can toggle the slicing functionality from the right menu by clicking on any axis name.

Slicing functionality can also be combined with any type of View mode (point cloud, vector fields, etc.). At the same time, you can toggle multiple slicing planes in x/y/z axis .

If you're working with velocity in your simulations, it's possible to animate even the steady-state simulation output by selecting "Vector fields - phase flow" from View Mode selector in the left menu:
