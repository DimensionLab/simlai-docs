# Fully connected MLP

Default neural network architecture in SIML.ai visual editor is a fully connected multi-layer perceptron (MLP).

"Fully connected" means that each neuron in each layer within the neural network applies a linear transformation 
to the input vector through a weights matrix. As a result, all possible connections layer-to-layer are present, 
meaning every input of the input vector influences every output of the output vector.

Fully-connected neural network (MLP) architecture, pre-selected at first inside 
[Neural network node](/model-engineer/visual-editor/neural-net-node/) within SIML.ai visual editor, has 6 layers, 
each containing 512 perceptrons, and uses the "swish" (also known as SiLU) activation function. All these parameters - 
e.g., the number of layers, the number of perceptrons in each layer, and the activation function to use for each layer - 
are user configurable. Default values are known to work, though they might not be optimal for your specific problem.
