# Modified Fourier Neural Network

Fourier Neural network is highly effective for dealing with problems that have sudden changes or there are different 
materials interfacing - when training physics-informed neural networks to solve such problems, it involves working with 
sharp gradients, which is very hard to handle in neural networks. A modified version of these networks can actually 
enhance their performance even more!

The modified version, inspired by a technique in <sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>, adds two transformation layers to project the 
Fourier features into a new learned feature space. These transformed features then update the hidden layers 
through element-wise multiplications, similar to the original technique in <sup>[1](#ref-1)</sup>.

This small tweak in the architecture has been shown to improve both the training convergence and accuracy. However, 
there's a trade-off: training time per iteration might increase a bit.
