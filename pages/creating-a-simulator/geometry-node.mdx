# Geometry Node

[Siml.ai](http://siml.ai/) offers both physics-informed and data-driven machine learning solutions for physics simulation issues. These solutions rely on representing the physics problem as a mathematical optimization problem, which is then applied to a specific geometry and/or data set.

Geometry node in Model Engineer visual editor lets users import an existing geometry from a CAD file or STL mesh.

When a geometry is imported, it is automatically converted into an STL mesh for training purposes. This is done through the Tesselation module, which samples points specified by the `Batch size` of the constraint node connected to the specific geometry node. But that's not all. The geometry is also converted into an isosurface for use in physics simulations within the [Siml.ai](http://siml.ai/) Simulation Studio and rendered in the Geometry viewer within [Siml.ai](http://siml.ai/) Model Engineer for a smooth interactive view of the complete geometry.
