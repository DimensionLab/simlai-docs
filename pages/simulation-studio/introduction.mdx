# Siml.ai Simulation Studio - An Introduction

Siml.ai Simulation Studio provides a web-based, 3D interface for high-fidelity, interactive visualizations 
of numerical simulations. It is used for solving engineering and scientific problems leveraging 
pre-trained and optimized models of AI-based physics simulators. Since the simulations are computed by 
inferring these models, the time it takes to compute one timestep even of highly irregular simulation 
domain is in seconds or possibly milliseconds, resulting in near-real-time simulation and visualization of 
physical phenomena.
