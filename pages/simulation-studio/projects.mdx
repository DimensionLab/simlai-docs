# Using Simulation Studio

Simulation Studio let's you easily create and run simulations. To start using it, you 
have to create new Project.

<Image
    src="/img/simlai-create-project.png"
    alt="Creating new Project"
    width={1280}
    height={720}
    style={{ margin: "10px auto" }}
/>
<figcaption style={{ textAlign: "center", fontSize: "0.7rem", marginBottom: "1rem" }}>
    Figure 1.: Creating new Project.
</figcaption>

You'll be able to access the creation popup by clicking on the "Create Project" button in the
Projects list page (click on "...show all" link in the left sidebar).

Make sure to select trained simulator model from the list of available models. If you don't have
any trained models, you can train one in the [Model Engineer's Environments](/model-engineer/environments) or use one of
publicly accessible ones (should be available in the same list already).
