# SIML.ai Model Engineer - An Introduction

SIML.ai Model Engineer is a tool for visually creating and optimizing general-purpose learnable simulators 
(e.g. for simulating fluid flows, multiphase flows, mechanical deformation, solid-fluid interaction and so on) 
using deep learning techniques. Our aim is to make the process of building such simulators simple, 
visual and understandable through a powerful visual editor.

### Visual nodes

The visual editor is based on a node-based graph, where each node represents a specific operation.

There are 4 types of nodes that user can drag-and-drop into the visual editor and use to build a simulator model:

    height={20}
    style={{ margin: "auto", marginTop: "15px" }}
/>
