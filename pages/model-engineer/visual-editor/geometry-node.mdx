# Geometry node

Siml.ai provides both physics-informed and data-driven machine learning solutions for physics simulation problems. 
All these solutions depend on expressing the physics problem as a mathematical optimization problem. 
The mathematical optimization problem is, in turn, posed on a particular geometry and/or set of data. 

Geometry node in Siml.ai Model Engineer visual editor lets users import an existing geometry from a CAD file or STL mesh.

When a geometry is imported, it is automatically converted to STL mesh for training purposes (Tesselation module will 
sample points specified by `Batch size` of the constraint node connected to the specific geometry node). But not just that - 
it's also converted to an isosurface for Siml.ai Simulation Studio to use in physics simulations, and to a fast, web-based 
representation for smooth, interactive rendering in geometry viewer inside Siml.ai Model Engineer:
