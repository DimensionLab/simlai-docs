### Supported equations

We currently support the following equations:
- Basic equations like dot, curl, gradient
- Navier-Stokes equation
- Zero equation
- Advection-diffusion equation
- Diffusion equation
- Wave equation
- Helmoltz equation
- Linear elasticity equations
- Maxwell equation in real form
- Sommerfeld radiation condition
- Perfect Electric Conductor boundary condition

We're planning to add more equations in the future, but also we're working on implementating a way to include 
user-defined equations.

### Check equations represented as LaTeX

When clicking on the $f_x$ button, the equations for each exposed component is displayed in the pop-up in LaTeX format:
