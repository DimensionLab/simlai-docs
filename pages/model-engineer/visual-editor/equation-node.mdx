# Equation node

Provides a set of pre-defined mathematical equations that can be used to model a physics phenomenon.

### Supported equations

We currently support the following equations:
- Basic equations like dot, curl, normal gradient of a scalar
- Navier-Stokes equations for fluid flow
- Zero equation turbulence model
- Advection-diffusion equation
- Diffusion equation
- Wave equation
- Helmoltz equation
- Linear elasticity equations
- Linear elasticity plane stress equations
- Frequency domain Maxwell's equation
- Sommerfeld radiation condition
- Perfect Electric Conductor boundary condition

We're planning to add more equations in the future, but also we're working on implementating a way to include 
user-defined equations.

### Check equations represented as LaTeX

When clicking on the $f_x$ button (Fig. 2) the equations for each exposed component is displayed in the pop-up in LaTeX format (Fig. 3)
