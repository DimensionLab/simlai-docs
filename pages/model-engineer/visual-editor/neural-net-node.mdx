# Neural network node

Neural network node provides a selection of state-of-the-art deep learning architectures 
and schemes to be used specifically for complex multiphysics, data-driven, or hybrid
modeling. List of the architectures comes from NVIDIA's Modulus framework, which is used
in Siml.ai platform.
